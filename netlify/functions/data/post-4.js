    <p>Your Secundus Dermis tee represents a significant investment in quality, comfort, and innovation. With proper care, this premium garment will maintain its luxurious feel, perfect fit, and functional properties for years to come. Here's everything you need to know about caring for your investment.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding Your Fabric</h2>
    
    <p>Before diving into care instructions, it's important to understand what makes Secundus Dermis special:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Silk (40%):</strong> Provides natural temperature regulation and luxurious feel</li>
      <li><strong>Organic Cotton (35%):</strong> Offers breathability and softness</li>
      <li><strong>Spandex (20%):</strong> Ensures stretch and recovery for perfect fit</li>
      <li><strong>Ice-Cotton (5%):</strong> Adds cooling properties</li>
      <li><strong>Silver Infusion:</strong> Provides antimicrobial properties throughout the fabric</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each component requires specific care to maintain its properties and extend the garment's life.</p>
    
    <h2>Daily Care Routine</h2>
    
    <h3>After Each Wear</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Air Out:</strong> Hang your tee in a well-ventilated area for 30 minutes before storing</li>
      <li><strong>Check for Stains:</strong> Address any spots immediately for easier removal</li>
      <li><strong>Proper Storage:</strong> Hang or fold carefully to prevent wrinkles and maintain shape</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Between Wears</h3>
    <p>Thanks to the silver infusion, your Secundus Dermis tee naturally resists odors and bacteria, meaning you can often wear it multiple times before washing—extending its life and reducing environmental impact.</p>
    
    <h2>Washing Instructions</h2>
    
    <h3>Frequency</h3>
    <p>Wash only when necessary. The antimicrobial properties mean you can wear your tee 2-3 times before washing, depending on activity level and personal preference.</p>
    
    <h3>Pre-Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stain Removal:</strong> Treat stains immediately with cold water and gentle, enzyme-free detergent</li>
      <li><strong>Deodorant Marks:</strong> Use white vinegar on a soft cloth to gently remove buildup</li>
      <li><strong>Oil Stains:</strong> Blot (don't rub) with cornstarch, let sit for 10 minutes, then brush off before washing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Machine Washing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Always use cold water (30°C/86°F or below)</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> Gentle or delicate cycle only</li>
      <li><strong>Load Size:</strong> Wash with similar colors and fabrics, avoid overloading</li>
      <li><strong>Detergent:</strong> Use gentle, sulfate-free detergent—avoid fabric softeners</li>
      <li><strong>Special Consideration:</strong> Turn inside out to protect the outer surface</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Hand Washing (Recommended)</h3>
    <p>For maximum longevity, hand washing is ideal:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a clean basin with cold water</li>
      <li>Add a small amount of gentle detergent</li>
      <li>Submerge the tee and gently agitate for 2-3 minutes</li>
      <li>Let soak for 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Rinse thoroughly with cold water until no soap remains</li>
      <li>Gently squeeze (never wring) to remove excess water</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Drying Guidelines</h2>
    
    <h3>Air Drying (Preferred)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Method:</strong> Lay flat on a clean towel or hang on padded hangers</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Away from direct sunlight and heat sources</li>
      <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Gently reshape while damp to maintain fit</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Allow 4-6 hours for complete drying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Machine Drying (If Necessary)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heat Setting:</strong> Low heat only</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Remove while slightly damp to prevent over-drying</li>
      <li><strong>Dryer Sheets:</strong> Avoid—they can interfere with the silver infusion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
    
    <h3>Detergents and Chemicals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bleach:</strong> Never use bleach—it will damage the silver infusion and fabric fibers</li>
      <li><strong>Fabric Softeners:</strong> These coat fibers and reduce the effectiveness of silver ions</li>
      <li><strong>Harsh Detergents:</strong> Avoid products with sulfates, phosphates, or optical brighteners</li>
      <li><strong>Dry Cleaning:</strong> The chemicals used can damage the specialized fabric blend</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Maintaining the Silver Infusion</h2>
    
    <p>The antimicrobial silver infusion is a key feature of your Secundus Dermis tee. To maintain its effectiveness:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gentle Washing:</strong> Harsh chemicals can reduce silver ion effectiveness</li>
      <li><strong>Proper pH:</strong> Use pH-neutral detergents to preserve silver properties</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Chlorine:</strong> Swimming pools and bleach can damage silver infusion</li>
      <li><strong>Regular Care:</strong> Proper washing actually helps redistribute silver ions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <p>Your Secundus Dermis tee is designed to be a long-term investment in your comfort and confidence. With proper care, it will maintain its luxurious feel, perfect fit, and innovative properties for years to come.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, the goal isn't just to clean your garment—it's to preserve all the qualities that make it special. By following these guidelines, you're ensuring that your investment continues to provide the comfort, support, and confidence you deserve, day after day.</p>
    
    <p>Quality care for a quality garment—it's that simple, and that important.</p>
